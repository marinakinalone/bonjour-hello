## Built with 

- HTML
- CSS & SCSS (SASS)
- [Party.js](https://party.js.org/)

## What's next to do?
On March 2022, I decided to update my portfolio, blog and landing page for personal links with newly acquired knowledge about design and coding.
202203: V.2 has been deployed and I'm pretty much done with this project atm. Next step is to make some improvments to my portfolio :)
## What I have learned from this project
Keep things simple! Sometimes, the combo HTML+CSS is more than enough...
